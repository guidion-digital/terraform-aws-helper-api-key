Small helper module to create API Gateway keys.

Keys for v1 APIs (REST APIs) can make use of both key and path level throttle and quota settings. See the [v1 example](./examples/v1_api/) for these features.

Keys for v2 APIs (WebSocket APIs) only have basic authorisation functionality. See the [v2 example](./examples/v2_api) for usage.
